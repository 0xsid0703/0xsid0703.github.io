# `utils/` [Directory](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/utils)

Nuxt 3 uses the `utils/` directory to automatically import helper functions and other utilities throughout your application using auto-imports!

>> The main purpose of the `utils/` directory is to allow a semantic distinction between your Vue composables and other auto-imported utility functions.The way utils/ auto-imports work and are scanned is identical to the [composables/ directory](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/composables). You can see examples and more information about how they work in that section of the docs.
